My venture into react-three-fiber (based on react-three-fiber starter)

### How to use

#### Installation

_Tailwind is the default style. styled-components (styled) is also available._

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app
# yarn create r3f-app <next> my-app <tailwind|styled>? -ts?
```

or

```sh
npx create-r3f-app next my-app
```

### :passport_control: Typescript

For typescript add the parameter `-ts` or `--typescript`:

```sh
yarn create r3f-app next my-app -ts
```

### :mount_fuji: Features

- [x] Automatically inject r3f component in the Canvas

### :bullettrain_side: Architecture

Inform the nextjs page that the component is a Threejs component. For that, simply add the **r3f** property to the parent component.

```jsx
const Page = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <div>Hello !</div>
      {/* Simply add the r3f prop to the parent component -> */}
      <MeshComponent r3f />
    </>
  )
}

export default Page
```
